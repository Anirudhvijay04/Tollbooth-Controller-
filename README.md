## 📌 Project Overview  
This project implements a *Tollbooth Controller* using *Verilog HDL*, simulating how smart toll systems work on highways.  
The design detects vehicles, verifies lane status, and controls the barrier gate accordingly.  

It has practical applications in *Smart Highways, Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), and Automated Toll Collection (ATC)*.  
This project was developed and tested on *Vivado* (Xilinx FPGA flow) and is also compatible with *EDAPlayground* for simulation.

## ✨ Features
- 🚙 *Vehicle Detection* – detects when a vehicle approaches the tollbooth.  
- ✅ *Lane Status Verification* – checks if the path/pavement is valid.  
- 🟢 *Barrier Control* – raises or lowers the barrier based on authentication.  
- 🖥️ *Verilog Testbench* – simulates different vehicle and path conditions.  
- ⚡ FPGA Compatible – ready to be synthesized and tested on Xilinx FPGAs.
