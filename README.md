## 📌 Project Overview  
This project implements a *Tollbooth Controller* using *Verilog HDL*, simulating how smart toll systems work on highways.  
The design detects vehicles, verifies lane status, and controls the barrier gate accordingly.  

It has practical applications in *Smart Highways, Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), and Automated Toll Collection (ATC)*.  
This project was developed and tested on *Vivado* (Xilinx FPGA flow) and is also compatible with *EDAPlayground* for simulation.
